# Budgetplex
## An awful version of Mineplex on a budget

Budgetplex is all in one repository, [Google-style](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-google-builds-a-web-framework-5eeddd691dea).
Therefore, `master` is always stable enough to use in production.

## Building

Simply go into each module's folder and execute the following:

### Windows

    gradlew jar

### Linux/macOS

    ./gradlew jar

## Following the License

Want to modify Budgetplex for your own server? Go right ahead! Just make sure to
follow the AGPL license. In other words, you must distribute your modified code
somewhere on the Internet. A really easy way to do that is to just fork this
GitHub repository and keep it public.

If you know of anyone violating the license, please open an issue on this GitHub
repository!
