# libbudgetplex
## The library backing every Budgetplex plugin

## Goals

 - [ ] Provide a minigame API that abstracts the Bukkit API away enough to transition decently easily to Sponge (, etc.)
       if necessary
 - [ ] Allow all games to share currency, lobbies, common UI elements
 - [ ] Make it possible to create a minigame in 20 minutes
